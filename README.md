## Downloading Tiktok Videos

Downloading video from TikTok presents a unique challenge: the watermark. TikTok dynamically applies a watermark to its videos, which is not part of the original file but is overlaid during the download process initiated from their app. To provide a clean, watermark-free video, this extension must intercept the original video data *before* this overlay is applied. 

It works by analyzing the network requests made by the TikTok web player to identify the raw video source URL, which is often temporary and obfuscated, allowing for a direct download of the pristine video file.
